      <h1> Envy </h1>
      <p> Up until last year, I had a precious demon-dog named Envy. He was an annoying little guy, but he was <em>my</em> annoying little guy. Here is my dedication web page to him. </p>
      <p> In this web page, you will find some cute pictures of him, and also some not-so-cute pictures.</p>
      <h3> Here he is looking adorable </h3>
      <img src="images/envy1.jpg" alt="envy1" >
      <img src="images/envy3.jpg" alt="envy3" />
      <h3> Here are some unflattering pictures of my boy </h3>
      <img src="images/envy2.jpg" alt="envy2" />
      <img src="images/envy4.jpg" alt="envy4" />
      <img src="images/envy7.jpg" alt="envy7" />
      <p>If he looks extremely spoiled, that's because he was. He pretty much owned the entire couch and was able to get treats on command. Who could resist his adorable little face? </p>
      <p> He was 100% Pomeranian and also 100% filled with rage, as you will observe in the following 2 pictures. </p>
