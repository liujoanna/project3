      <h1>Wauconda</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a little suburban town Northwest of here called Wauconda (not to be confused with the fictional East African country "Wakanda" from Marvel's Black Panther).
      Wauconda is located in Lake County, Illinois, and currently has a population of close to 14,000.

      <h3> Courtesy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wauconda,_Illinois">Wikipedia</a>, here is a little excerpt on the history of Wauconda: </h3>
      <p>According to local legend, Wauconda was supposedly named after an indigenous chief whose name translated to "spirit water". Many indigenous people had already migrated westwards when the first settlers arrived. Many early settlers of Wauconda came from New England and New York by covered wagon or through the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes.</p>
      <p>Elihu Hubbard built the first log cabin on the bank of Bangs Lake in 1836. Justus Bangs, the first settler in Wauconda, built a house next to the lake in 1848 and the lake was later named after him. In 1840, members of the Winnebago tribe who did not leave the shores of the Fox River often went to the area to trade. In 1849, Wauconda was formally organized and the first town meeting was held in April 1850 on the first Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Wauconda's first school was built in 1839 and the area's post office was moved to Wauconda on June 27, 1849, with Hazard Green becoming its first postmaster.</p>
      <p>Elder Joel Wheeler of McHenry built the first Baptist church in Wauconda in the autumn of 1838. A Methodist church was organized on September 3, 1852 by Reverend C. French, and built in 1856 on the Commons. Both Methodists and Baptists attended prayer at the church until February 1870, when the Baptists reorganized and built a new church on October 30, 1870. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1877 and its first trustees were James Murray, Charles Davlin, Felix Givens, Hugh Davlin, and Owen McMahon. Its first priest was Father O'Neil.</p>
      <p>In 1850, Wauconda had a population of around 200 residents, and the town had three goods stores, two public houses and various mechanics.</p>
